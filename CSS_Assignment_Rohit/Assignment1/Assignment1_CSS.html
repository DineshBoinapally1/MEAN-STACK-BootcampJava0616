                <p>Different types of paint are usually identified by the medium that the pigment is suspended or embedded in, which determines the general working characteristics of the paint, such as viscosity, miscibility, solubility, drying time, etc.</p>

                    <dd title="Description for Oil Painting">Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments that are bound with a medium of drying oil-especially in early modern Europe, linseed oil. Often an oil such as linseed was boiled with a resin such as pine resin or even frankincense; these were called 'varnishes' and were prized for their body and gloss. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Pastel</strong></dt>
                    <dd title="Description for Pastels">Pastel is a painting medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder.The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.Because the surface of a pastel painting is fragile and easily smudged, its preservation requires protective measures such as framing under glass; it may also be sprayed with a fixative.</dd>
